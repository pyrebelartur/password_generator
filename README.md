# Password Generator

This is my **5th Python project** — a simple, interactive password generator.  
It lets the user customize how many letters, symbols, and numbers should be included in a randomly generated, secure password.

## 🔐 Features

- Generates passwords using uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Characters are fully randomized for added security.
- User chooses how many letters, symbols, and numbers the password should contain.
- Clean, beginner-friendly code written in a classic, step-by-step style.

🧠 What I Learned from This Project
This project helped me solidify key programming concepts in Python. It was a great opportunity to build something functional from scratch.

✅ Python Concepts Practiced:

- Lists: Creating, appending elements with append(), combining multiple lists using +, and converting them to strings with ''.join().
- Loops: Using for loops to generate multiple random characters based on user input.
- User Input: Getting data from the user using input() and converting it to integers with int().
- Randomization: Using the random module — random.choice() to select elements, and random.shuffle() to mix them.
- String manipulation: Building the final password as a single string from randomized characters.
- Code structure: Organizing code clearly — input → logic → output.
